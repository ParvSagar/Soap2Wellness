        <h2>Making a Difference Together</h2>
        <p>
            At Soap2Wellness, we believe that even small steps can lead to meaningful change.
            By working closely with local restaurants and NGOs, we have created a ripple effect of positive
            impact across environmental, economic, and social spheres.
        </p>

                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Improper disposal of used cooking oil can contaminate water supplies, harm marine life,
                    and contribute to pollution. Through our initiative, we’ve recycled over
                    <strong>500 liters of used oil</strong>, preventing these harmful consequences and promoting
                    a healthier ecosystem.

                <h3>Social Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Our program has trained over <strong>50 individuals</strong> from NGOs in the art of soap-making,
                    providing them with skills that empower them economically. The revenue generated from
                    the soap sales goes directly into supporting their families and communities.

                <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    By purchasing used oil from restaurants and transforming it into a valuable product,
                    we’ve created a circular economy that benefits everyone involved. Our soaps have
                    reached over <strong>1,000 customers</strong>, spreading awareness about sustainability
                    and responsible production.

            <p>
                Meet Priya, a single mother who joined our program six months ago. With no prior experience
                in soap-making, she was trained by our team and now contributes to making hundreds of soaps
                every month. Her earnings have helped her send her children to school and secure a stable
                future for her family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meet Ravi, a college graduate who struggled to find a job in his small town. Frustrated but
                determined, Ravi enrolled in our program, where he discovered his talent for creating innovative 
                soap designs. Ravi now runs a small soap business, employing three others from his community. 
                His journey from unemployment to entrepreneurship has inspired many young people in his area to 
                take up sustainable trades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meet Rekha, a school dropout from a remote village. Limited by opportunities, Rekha joined our 
                program to learn soap-making and contribute to her family’s income. What started as a way to help 
                her parents has grown into a skill that Rekha uses to teach others in her village about sustainable 
                practices. Rekha dreams of starting her own eco-friendly business one day and is already mentoring 
                other young women in her area.
