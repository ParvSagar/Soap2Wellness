            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Every year, millions of liters of used cooking oil are improperly disposed of, harming the environment and posing significant health risks.
                At Soap2Wellness, we aim to turn this waste into a resource by connecting restaurants with NGOs to recycle used cooking oil
                into eco-friendly soaps. By doing so, we create jobs, promote sustainable practices, and contribute to a healthier planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our initiative serves a dual purpose: to reduce the harmful effects of used oil on the environment and to empower local communities
                by providing skills and economic opportunities. Together, we are addressing global challenges like waste management, responsible production,
                and economic inequality.
